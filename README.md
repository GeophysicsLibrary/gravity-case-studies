# Case studies: Gravity data from around the world

In this lesson, we'll explore the gravity data from a few different locations
and discuss what it can tell us about the isostatic state of the lithosphere.

## Concept

The lesson is designed for graduate and undergraduate students who have a
background in geology and geophysics and some knowledge of the theoretical
concepts of gravity anomalies and isostasy.
The overall goal is to introduce learners to real world examples and data that
illustrate the theoretical concepts that they have already acquired.
We'll do this by providing learners with data and the tools for exploring it
interactively.
The full lesson will take approximately 1.5 hours to complete.


## Learning objectives

* Reinforce theoretical concepts with real world examples
* Explore the relationship between plate tectonics, isostasy, and the gravity
* Visualize glacial isostatic rebound and flexure of the lithosphere at
  convergent margins and their effects on the Earth's gravity field


## Prerequisites

This lesson assumes basic knowledge of:

* The layering of the Earth (crust, mantle, core, lithosphere, asthanosphere)
  <[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth)>
  <[SEG wiki](https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Layers_of_the_Earth)>
* The Earth gravity field (gravitational and rotational components) and Normal
  gravity
* The gravity disturbance
* The gravitational effect of topography and the Bouguer correction
* Isostasy (Airy–Heiskanen, Pratt-Hayford, and Vening Meinesz models) and it's
  relationship with the topography-free gravity disturbance

that seasoned contributors have glossed over. If you can write any code at all,
you can contribute code to open source projects. We are constantly trying out
new skills, making mistakes, and learning from those mistakes. That's how we
all improve and we are happy to help others learn.
